Execute a bash command in the terminal.

Use this tool when you need to:
- Run git commands (status, diff, log, add, commit, etc.)
- Run build commands (python, uv, npm, make, etc.)
- Check system information
- Navigate directories
- Any shell command execution

Do NOT use this tool for:
- Simple file reading (use read tool instead)
- File editing (use edit tool instead)
- Searching files (use glob tool instead)

Important:
- The command runs in the project directory by default
- You can specify a different working directory with workdir
- Commands have a 2 minute timeout by default
- Dangerous commands (rm, mv, cp, chmod, etc.) require extra caution
