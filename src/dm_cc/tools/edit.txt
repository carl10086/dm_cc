Performs exact string replacements in files.

Usage:
- You must use your `Read` tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt to edit without reading the file.
- When editing text from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the oldString or newString.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- The edit will FAIL if `oldString` is not unique in the file.
- Use `replaceAll` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.
- Before applying any edit, a diff will be displayed for user confirmation. The user must approve (y/n) before the edit is applied.
